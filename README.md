This Python script scrapes the latest Australian HS (Harmonized System) tariff codes from all chapters under the Schedule 3 main URL on the ABF website. It extracts the code hierarchy (Chapter, Heading, Subheading) and descriptions, then exports the data as a structured Excel file (hs_code_tree.xlsx) in a tree-view format.
